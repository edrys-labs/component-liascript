# Edrys LiaScript Component

This module allows you to add interactive content and guides to an Edrys class. This includes galleries, audio, quizzes, surveys, code runners, and more. It is based on LiaScript, which allows you to specify all this functionality in simple plaintext, shared over course URLs.

## Usage

Simply use this URL to add the module to your class:

```
https://edrys-labs.github.io/compoent-liascript/
```

You must specify the following configuration:

```
{
    "course": "LIASCRIPT_COURSE_URL"
}
```
